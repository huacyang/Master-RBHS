                <p>Featured in <a href="http://magazine.rutgers.edu/departments/winter-2013/on-the-banks/rx-for-medicine" target="_blank">Rutgers Magazine</a>, Rutgers alumna LeAnne Roberts, CC’07, a fifth-year medical student at the New Jersey Medical School, chairs the American Medical Association’s 48,000-member Medical Student Section.<br/>
<br/>
“We provide students with a platform to launch their profession,” says Roberts. “Whether they’re thinking about becoming the best neurosurgeon in the country or going into policy and advocacy as a physician, we provide a training ground.”</p>
