As the inaugural Chancellor of Rutgers Behavioral Health Sciences, I am thrilled to have a leadership role in the most significant transformation of higher education in New Jersey in the past 40 years. With today’s expanded medical and other health professions education at Rutgers, RBHS provides increased academic opportunities for students and allows Rutgers to excel in medical, dental, nursing, pharmacy, and basic health sciences research, education, service, and patient care.
