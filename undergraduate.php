                <p>RBHS undergraduate programs include certificates as well as A.A.S., A.S., B.S., B.S.N., and PharmD. degrees. Nearly 2,400 students enroll in our undergraduate programs each year. The programs range from certificates in dental assisting and vascular sonography to B.S. degrees in nursing and clinical laboratory science to the six-year doctor of pharmacy (PharmD), the entry-level degree for pharmacists. Some programs require full time attendance, while others offer part-time options.</p>
