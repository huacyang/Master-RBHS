                <p>Clinical trials are scientific research studies designed to find better ways to treat or prevent diseases. RBHS has clinical research at every school and campus, involving hundreds of researchers. The faculty at our three medical schools, our dental school, nursing schools, and other allied health schools are dedicated to moving forward discovery in drugs, biologics, devices, preventive and therapeutic strategies, behavioral research, and other interventions to improve human life. RBHS supports more than 100 industry-sponsored clinical trials on any given day of the year. </p>

            <h2>Clinical Trials for Cancer</h2>
                <p>As New Jersey&rsquo;s only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer centers, the <a href="http://cinj.org" target="_blank">Cancer Institute of New Jersey</a> is able to provide access to clinical trials not available at other hospitals, clinics, or doctor&rsquo;s offices. The institute enrolls more than 3,000 patients in clinical trials or approximately 15 percent of all its new adult cancer patients; nationwide fewer than 5 percent of adult cancer patients participate in clinical trials. Among the institute&rsquo;s pediatric cancer patients, 70 percent are on clinical trials. <a href="http://www.cinj.org/clinical-trials/clinical-trials-overview" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.<br/>
